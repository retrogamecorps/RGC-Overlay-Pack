These shaders are derived from the following community products:

sharp-shimmerless (GLSL and SLANG) 

From RetroArch:

crt-1tap
zfast_crt_geo_svideo

Chances are these shaders are installed on your device already, but I noticed they weren't installed on muOS by default.  The crt-1tap is a nice subtle CRT effect, whereas the zfast-crt-geo-svideo is much more dramatic.
